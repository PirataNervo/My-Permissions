## My Permissions

My Permissions is a plugin for MyBB which allows you control permissions (NOT IN ACP) that you can't control using the default permissions system.
For example, if there's a plugin you're using that doesn't have any permissions settings, you can use this plugin to restrict usage.

You can choose which field and which value get filtered and which usergroups are affected.
This is an advanced plugin, that means only advanced users might be able to use this plugin properly.
